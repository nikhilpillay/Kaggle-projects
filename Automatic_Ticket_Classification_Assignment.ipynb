            "Hi, I had applied for a loan modification through Chase Bank for my mortgage held by XXXX XXXX XX/XX/XXXX. I have had several SPOC ( single point of contact ) and been in touch with executive office as well as escalation department. This application was denied and I have since sent in a new application per advise from the executive office. I am having extreme trouble getting the correct information to help me with the process. Everything from, no phone calls and return calls from my SPOC, executive office, to verbal miss information about my modification qualifying or not. I could not get a solid answer of why I was denied. I was told I could n't get a modification because my property was n't owner occupied and then I could but needed more income. I feel Chase is violating OCC rules by not sending me this information in writing and not submitting a COMPLETE MODIFICATION PACKAGE which was complete XXXX/XXXX/XXXX and not being submitted until XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. In limbo for more than two months. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX a representative XXXX read the notes and told me the modification package was ready for underwriting on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX. I have tried to reach my most recent SPOC XXXX XXXX several times with no success. He has been my contact since XXXX XXXX, XXXX when he was assigned to my file. A month will go by before he calls me back. has told me he \" has XXXX accounts and is very busy ''. He said he \" will get off the phone with me and get right back on, he is on the phone all day ''. I have called his supervisor about this matter and that did n't resolve the issue. On XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX told me Chase took me \" off his portfolio '' my \" file is in limbo. I have since submitted a new application on XXXX/XXXX/XXXX through XXXX fax sheet Chase provided. I called XXXX XXXX XXXX/XXXX/XXXX he was not available nor has he called me back. I spoke with XXXX XXXX and let her know I faxed application. I called XXXX/XXXX/XXXX XXXX not available spoke with XXXX XXXX she said they received application. Explained to her the issues I have had so please have XXXX call me so we can go over it. No call from XXXX! \n",
            "I got a call from XXXX XXXX in the escalation department he says to call him if I have a problem. When we went over my application he told me I would not qualify because my sons income was too much. When I asked for an explanation he was taking 2 months of pay stubs and using it as 1 month income. I pointed out his mistake and also let him know if he would look at the contribution amount on the application it states exactly what my son contributes. I have no confidence in this representative from the escalation department, my SPOC, or executive office. I am dealing with untrained representatives. Getting different answers to same question. misinformation and not getting it in writing. I have taken detailed note of who I speak with, dates and their extension number. Please contact me if you need all the details.\n",

such fake checks were cleared from my checking account normally i would rarely write any checks in the past i wrote probably one check a month or so\\n\\nchase proceeded to approve these transactions and cleared funds from my account i was alerted to this happening by automated email from chase about my account being overdrawn in addition to fraudulent transactions chase charged three separate overdraft fees to my account \\n\\nupon receiving an alert and realizing the problem on  i contacted chase by phone then visited the branch where i opened a claim with chase chase froze the account and informed that it would take  days to process my claim\\n\\ntwo weeks later as of  chase has not refunded my money  around   and is claiming that the investigation is still ongoing \\n\\ni asked why chase can not proceed with reimbursing me while their investigation is ongoing but did not receive a satisfactory response \\n\\nessentially the same can happen to anybody with a chase checking

such fake checks were cleared from my checking account normally i would rarely write any checks in the past i wrote probably one check a month or so\\n\\nchase proceeded to approve these transactions and cleared funds from my account i was alerted to this happening by automated email from chase about my account being overdrawn in addition to fraudulent transactions chase charged three separate overdraft fees to my account \\n\\nupon receiving an alert and realizing the problem on  i contacted chase by phone then visited the branch where i opened a claim with chase chase froze the account and informed that it would take  days to process my claim\\n\\ntwo weeks later as of  chase has not refunded my money  around   and is claiming that the investigation is still ongoing \\n\\ni asked why chase can not proceed with reimbursing me while their investigation is ongoing but did not receive a satisfactory response \\n\\nessentially the same can happen to anybody with a chase checking
